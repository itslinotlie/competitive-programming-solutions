# Competitive Programming Solutions

Stuck on a specific problem and not sure how to continue? Does reading the problem statement make you question your English comprehension skills? Well, you've come to the right place. When editorials aren't available, taking a peek at a solution can help overcome the wall you're currently facing.

Within this repository will contain my solutions from judges, including [DM::OJ](https://dmoj.ca/) and [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com), as well as competitions, including various IOs, CCC, CCO, COCI, DMOPC, DWITE, ECOO, and USACO. Efficiency cannot be guaranteed, but the solutions all contain a header that links to the respective platform where it ACs.

### PSA

Because the solutions are written for competitions, where time is of the essence, the code contains software practices that should be avoided. Global variables are frequent in the code, and all the C++ and Java libraries are imported. Readers should keep this in mind and be aware not to code like such outside of programming contests.
